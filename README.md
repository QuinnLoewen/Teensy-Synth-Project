## üéõÔ∏è Features

- **8-Voice Polyphony:** Simultaneously play up to 8 notes with dynamic voice allocation.
- **Multiple Modes:** Includes Polyphonic, Snap-Back (monophonic), and Arpeggiator modes.
- **Real-Time Controls:** Adjust ADSR envelope, LFO modulation, waveform selection, and built-in effects via hardware controls.
- **USB MIDI Integration:** Compatible with most USB MIDI controllers.
- **High-Fidelity Audio:** PCM5102A DAC, analog filtering, and effects for professional audio quality.
- **Visual Feedback:** Integrated TFT display shows waveform type, ADSR envelope, and LFO settings.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) with [Teensyduino](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_download.html)
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with Arduino extension (optional but recommended)
- Required libraries:
  - Teensy Audio Library
  - USBHost_t36 Library
  - Adafruit GFX Library
  - Adafruit ST7735 Library

### Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Teensy-Synth-Project.git
cd Teensy-Synth-Project
Hardware Assembly:
Consult the Hardware/Schematics/ folder for circuit diagrams.
Assemble hardware components according to provided schematics and PCB layouts.
Software Installation:
Open the Synthesizer.ino file located in Software/ in Arduino IDE.
Set board type to Teensy 4.1.
Install required libraries through Arduino Library Manager.
Upload the sketch to the Teensy 4.1.


üéöÔ∏è Usage
Mode Button: Switch between Polyphonic, Snap-back, and Arpeggiator modes.
Waveform Button: Cycle through available waveform types (Sine, Square, Triangle, Sawtooth).
Effect Button: Enable or disable the global delay effect.
Potentiometers: Adjust Attack, Decay, Sustain, Release (ADSR envelope) and LFO parameters in real-time.
Display: TFT screen displays current mode, waveform type, ADSR envelope, and LFO parameters.


üß™ Testing & Results
Detailed test procedures and results are located in the Test_Results/ directory:
MIDI Latency Tests: Measured MIDI-to-audio latency (~1.2 ms average).
Polyphony Performance: Verified 8-voice polyphony with stable CPU usage (~55%).
Audio Quality Tests: Confirmed THD < 0.01% and SNR > 100 dB.
