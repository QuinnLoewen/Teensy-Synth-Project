## üéõÔ∏è Features

- **8-Voice Polyphony:** Simultaneously play up to 8 notes with dynamic voice allocation.
- **Multiple Modes:** Includes Polyphonic, Snap-Back (monophonic), and Arpeggiator modes.
- **Real-Time Controls:** Adjust ADSR envelope, LFO modulation, waveform selection, and built-in effects via hardware controls.
- **USB MIDI Integration:** Compatible with most USB MIDI controllers.
- **High-Fidelity Audio:** PCM5102A DAC, analog filtering, and effects for professional audio quality.
- **Visual Feedback:** Integrated TFT display shows waveform type, ADSR envelope, and LFO settings.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) with [Teensyduino](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_download.html)
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with Arduino extension (optional but recommended)
- Required libraries:
  - Teensy Audio Library
  - USBHost_t36 Library
  - Adafruit GFX Library
  - Adafruit ST7735 Library

### Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Teensy-Synth-Project.git
   cd Teensy-Synth-Project
   ```

2. **Hardware Assembly:**
   - Consult the `Hardware/Schematics/` folder for circuit diagrams.
   - Assemble hardware components according to provided schematics and PCB layouts.

3. **Software Installation:**
   - Open the `Synthesizer.ino` file located in `Software/` in Arduino IDE.
   - Set board type to `Teensy 4.1`.
   - Install required libraries through Arduino Library Manager.
   - Upload the sketch to the Teensy 4.1.

## üéöÔ∏è Usage

- **Mode Button:** Switch between Polyphonic, Snap-back, and Arpeggiator modes.
- **Waveform Button:** Cycle through available waveform types (Sine, Square, Triangle, Sawtooth).
- **Effect Button:** Enable or disable the global delay effect.
- **Potentiometers:** Adjust Attack, Decay, Sustain, Release (ADSR envelope) and LFO parameters in real-time.
- **Display:** TFT screen displays current mode, waveform type, ADSR envelope, and LFO parameters.

## üß™ Testing & Results

Detailed test procedures and results are located in the `Test_Results/` directory:

- **MIDI Latency Tests:** Measured MIDI-to-audio latency (~1.2 ms average).
- **Polyphony Performance:** Verified 8-voice polyphony with stable CPU usage (~55%).
- **Audio Quality Tests:** Confirmed THD < 0.01% and SNR > 100 dB.
