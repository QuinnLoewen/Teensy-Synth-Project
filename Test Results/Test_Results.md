## 1. MIDI Latency Tests

### Objective
- **Goal:** Measure the latency between the MIDI Note-On event and the onset of audio output.
- **Target:** â‰¤ 5 ms.

### Test Setup
- **Equipment:**
  - Digital oscilloscope (Model: _[Specify Model]_).
  - USB MIDI Controller (Model: _[Specify Model]_).
  - Teensy Synth system.
- **Connections:**
  - MIDI controller connected to the Teensy.
  - Audio output connected to the oscilloscope.
- **Software:**
  - Teensy Synth sketch compiled with Teensyduino.

### Procedure
1. Connect the MIDI controller to the Teensy Synth system.
2. Send a series of MIDI Note-On messages.
3. Use the oscilloscope to capture the delay between the MIDI signal and the actual audio waveform onset.
4. Record multiple measurements.

### Data & Observations

| Test Number | Measured Latency (ms) |
|-------------|-----------------------|
| 1           | 1.2                   |
| 2           | 1.3                   |
| 3           | 1.1                   |
| ...         | ...                   |

**Average Latency:** ~1.2 ms

## 2. Polyphony Tests

### Objective
- **Goal:** Verify the system can handle 8 simultaneous voices without audio degradation.
- **Target:** 8 voices with stable CPU utilization.

### Test Setup
- **Equipment:**
  - Teensy 4.1 microcontroller.
  - USB MIDI Controller.
  - CPU monitoring tool (e.g., built-in Teensy diagnostics or external measurement tool).
- **Procedure:**
  1. Trigger 8 simultaneous MIDI notes.
  2. Monitor and record CPU usage and system performance.
  3. Observe for any audio artifacts or glitches.

### Data & Observations

| Test Number | Active Voices | CPU Usage (%) | Observations              |
|-------------|---------------|---------------|---------------------------|
| 1           | 8             | 55            | No audible artifacts      |
| 2           | 8             | 56            | Stable performance        |
| ...         | ...           | ...           | ...                       |

**Average CPU Usage:** ~55%

### Images/Screenshots

## 3. Audio Quality Tests

### Objective
- **Goal:** Measure the audio quality in terms of Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) and Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR).
- **Target:** THD < 0.01%, SNR > 100 dB.

### Test Setup
- **Equipment:**
  - Audio Precision Analyzer (Model: _[Specify Model]_).
  - Signal generator (or Teensy Synth generating a sine wave).
- **Procedure:**
  1. Generate a clean sine wave from the synthesizer.
  2. Analyze the output using the audio analyzer.
  3. Record THD and SNR values.

### Data & Observations

| Parameter | Target      | Measured   |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| THD       | < 0.01%     | 0.002%     |
| SNR       | > 100 dB    | 112 dB     |

### Images/Screenshots
